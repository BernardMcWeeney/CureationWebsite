J﻿une the 8th 2019 was my very first taste of concert going and what a gig to kick it all off! The iconic Slane venue with absolute rockers Metallica.

I was naturally a huge Metallica fan, playing there songs daily throughout my first years in college. It  never dawned on me that I could actually go and see them live. It was only when I found out my aunties had tickets and were trying to sell them as something else was on the same day as them, that it crossed my mined to get them. Now they were steep if I remember something around €100 for them. M﻿yself and my good friend Nulty joined together and we decided to make the trip. 

I﻿ was so excited for the concert, playing their songs and newest album on repeat for the weeks leading up to the event. Nulty organised a bus from Drogheda to get us to Slane. 

O﻿n the morning of the gig, my dad brought me on a trip around Slane castle in an attempt to see how close we could get without getting stopped or blocked by a barricade. I remember clearly my dad playing master of puppets in the car and us rocking away to it.

G﻿ot a lift and collected Nulty and we headed into Drogheda, Nulty thankfully brought some cans and we enjoyed the trip over on the double decker. It was raining away but I didn't care. It was my first real experience of concerts and drinking publicly, all very new. 

We departed from the bus and began making our way to the castle, the place was buzzing with mad rockers, definitely an older crowd but that's whats I love about music, it transcends generations! We had to down our cans at the Garda checkpoint, at this point I was very happy : )

I﻿n we went to the castle and Ghost were playing, dressed as a pope rocking on the stage, they do catch the eye. I enjoyed their set and so did the crowd. More drinks were had and then we met a bunch of people from my secondary school and we had a great time chatting and drinking.

T﻿hen the real fun began, Metallica were next. At this stage I had stopped drinking and was ready to experience the full set authentically. Highlights for me was:

* The Ecstasy of Gold intro - goosebumps
* The Memory Remains
* M﻿oth into flame
* Whiskey in a Jar
* Frantic
* O﻿ne - the war scene was just fantastic, I could actually feel the heat of the fires!!
* Creeping Death

T﻿he encore goes without saying was just brilliant. Me being a complete noob at concert actually though they had finished and I was so disappointed they didn't play Nothing else matters and Sandman.... but of course they did, they came one with the amazing:

* S﻿pit out the bone - I loved this song from their new album at the time. Nice choreography of zooming into the guitar pick only for it to show the Slane and Irish flag.
* N﻿othing else matters - Very nice touch of dedicating the song to someone local who recently passed due to suicide.
* E﻿nter Sandman - epic end to an epic concert

T﻿he walk back up to the bus was something else as well, everyone flooding back onto the main village street of Slane, the night was so heavy, you could feel the heavy heat. Eventually made it to the bus and we were cramed in back to Drogheda. Went and got a pizza at a local pizza sit down takeaway and talked about it all. Then was home at a reasonable enough hour after 12pm, closing off a brilliant day and taking my concert virginity away.
