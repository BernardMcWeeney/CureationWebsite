summary: My coding story so far and where I want to go.
---
I have always loved technology, I loved messing about on an old desktop or a laptop and became the family "tech guy". I always watched the latest Apple releases and my YouTube history would be of MKDBH and Linus Tech Tips. While I know a lot of this is consumer interest it was the gateway that led me to pursue something in technology. 


My interests are not only software specific, I love the hardware aspects of technology, the infrastructure that powers it all. I decked my home out in Unifi gear, installed IP cameras and modernised my home with smart home devices. 


All this fed into my decision to pick a college course geared towards technology, but I was also interested in the business side of things as well – I love a good old entrepreneurial book! I am inspired by entrepreneurs. This business interest combined with my interest in technology naturally led me to pick Enterprise Computing in DCU. I loved this course, coming 1st in my Final Year! It set me up to be a project manager or scrum master with a wide knowledge of the areas of a technology team from the software life cycle to the infrastructure. 


However there is one element of this course that I wish was changed, it lacked the main software concepts. I wish I learned about software data structures, software algorithms, I wish JavaScript was taught to us. I know I can learn all these things and that’s what I plan on doing. 


I decided to take a masters course in Secure Software Development, this was really beneficial for me, it expanded my knowledge of software and the fundamental building blocks of secure systems. I know I have a good base to jump from to become a developer and so for this year my sole priority is to learn to code.


My programmer journey begins now, I want to become a frontend developer, in the future I’ll expand into different areas but my sole priority is to be a frontend developer. I see my roadmap as the one listed on this website: [Frontend Developer Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend)


The mid point of 2023 and I begin my journey as a developer, wish me luck!
