## The Magic of Summer Nights

As I sit staring at the star filled night sky with Numb by The Cure playing in the background, I wonder at how awesome the summer nights are here in Ireland. We are drawing closer to the longest day of the year and with a bit of dread, a reminder of how short the summer is and how fleeting these magical summer nights are. What makes a summer night magical? Its the feeling, the feeling of not wanting to go to bed at your routine hour, the feeling of warmth in the air, the smell of cut grass and perfumed filled honey-suckle, the twinkle of the night sky and the electric feeling atmosphere.

It doesn't matter if you are alone or with company, the magic summer nights cast’s it’s spell on all! It is infectious! Like an old friend greeting you after a long stay away. In company, mystery, fun and excitement is the order of the night. Alone, a mix of the excitement of the days ahead and a melancholy feeling of the fleetness of it all lingers.

And when the magic of night fades away, a new day and a new perspective awaits. But the fondness of the magic summer nights never leave you, sustaining you until the next spell is cast.
